# Kickstarting with Excel

## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

### Purpose
This purpose of this analysis was to determine how variables affected the outcomes of kickstarter campaigns. Using the Kickstarter dataset, I visualized four outcomes - successful, failed, live, canceled - based on their launch dates and their fundraising goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis was to determine if the launch date month impacted the outcome of **Theater** fundraising campaigns.
